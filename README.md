# BSA (*Business & System Analysis*)

---

This folder contains assignments from the BSA (*Business & System Analysis*) training program [School 21](https://21-school.ru/we).

### The purpose of this thread:

---

1. **Product Optimization / Mastering Analytics Methods:**

> Analytics methods help identify the strengths and weaknesses of a product, allowing you to focus on improving key features and eliminating shortcomings. This helps increase efficiency, improve user experience, and achieve better business results. Data analysis helps make informed decisions, minimizing risks and avoiding ineffective decisions, which leads to successful product development and promotion.

###### 2. **Understanding Users:**

> Understanding user needs and behavior allows you to create a product that meets their expectations and brings real value. This contributes to successful promotion and strengthening of positions in the market.

###### 3. **Communication and teamwork skills:**

> Developing communication skills and the ability to work in a team allows you to effectively interact with various stakeholders (*managers, developers, marketers*) and clearly explain analytical findings. This helps speed up the decision-making process, implement changes and prevent misunderstandings in the team. These skills are important for creating a harmonious and productive work process.

###### 4. **A well-built business strategy:**

> Mastering the principles of building a business strategy helps to clearly define the company's goals and priorities based on analytical data. This helps make informed decisions on product development, functionality and marketing activities, which contributes to the company's growth, increased competitiveness and optimal use of resources to obtain maximum profit.

### Structure of this branch:

---

All these skills and knowledge are achieved through the completion of individual and group assignments using the **peer-to-peer** methodology of School 21.

This branch includes 17 assignments, of which 11 are individual and 6 are group. These projects will be stored in this directory and named with the **BSA** prefix, as well as a numeric value from 00 to 16.

Each of the folders will contain:

* Folder `src` (*files with my solution to the technical task in English*);
* Folder `src_rus` (*in Russian*);
* Files `TASK_RUS.md` and `TASK.md` (*Russian and English versions of the task*);
* Screenshot with the review results from the examiners at the school (*Peer-to-Peer methodology*).

Each project contains its own technical task (TT) and goals.

Why shove the entire model for compiling this document here, and not just the parts necessary for completing <br />the task, is not clear to me...<br /><br />I deliberately did not add the operator to the system, since I consider it an unnecessary element that only clutters the model<br />without adding value.<br /><br />Overall, I implemented the *As Is / To Be* model as a transition from an inefficient current system (*which I came up with*) to a <br />more optimized one (*with specific functionality in the form of requirements*).<br />The remaining tasks — building a context diagram and defining input/output flows — were completed without any particular <br />difficulties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Visualize relationships between entities indicating their multiplicity.<br />8. Describe relationships between entities using verbs.<br />9. Work with hypothetical scenarios.<br />10. Structure and format the results in tables and diagrams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | At first I thought it would be easy, but in the end it took me 1.5 months. Now I understand ER diagrams.<br /><br />**For those who will do the task:**<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking a course in SQL first. In fact, you are developing a database at a conceptual-logical level <br />*(which is not very difficult)*, but it is important to understand the principles of physical construction of the database in <br />order to avoid creating meaningless structures at the conceptual and logical levels *(as happened to me, and required 5 reworks).*<br /><br />I will also note that there are MUCH MORE entities than 7. 7 entities is a limitation. Tables that link M:M relationships are also entities<br /> and can have their own attributes *(which is what happens in 80% of cases)*, and there can be many such entities, and they can intersect<br />with each other. Of course, it may not be worth spending as much effort to complete this task as I did, but now I roughly understand<br /> how they work.<br /><br />I also recommend using the context diagram from the previous tasks and creating a DFD diagram before doing the task, it will help you understand <br />what repositories exist, as well as the corresponding entities *(since each entity stores something)*. You will need it in stages 05 or 06, I don’t remember<br /> exactly, but personally it helped me a lot to clarify a lot.<br /><br />The task is very complex in terms of subtleties and nuances. I recommend doing Chen’s notation first *(where you will clearly understand everything, <br />and then move on to Martin)*, at least for one of the tasks, because only then you will understand how it works.<br /><br />The task is very complex in terms of subtleties and nuances.

In addition, I did not reflect<br /> some points *(for example, payment, interaction with external systems, etc.)*, because I spent a lot of time to understand how to do this at all. If you <br />have any questions about the diagram, please contact me using the contact details provided in my resume that I sent you. |
